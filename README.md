# home-Co2

This project's aim is to develop a CO2 IoT meter. 
At the moment the first logical step is to test the 
sensor in a breadboard with minimum materials. 


The overall learning outcomes of the project are:
* Proper use of git (branches, commits, documentation)
* C/C++ development


From the hardware side:
* Practical experience with boost converter 
* Use of lipo battery (charger, read state)
* KiCAD and soldering
* Use industry common microcontrollers (e.g. STM) over arduino
